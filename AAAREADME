This directory should contain everything needed to run the CSU 1DVAR retrieval,
 except for the CRTM source code which is publicly available: 
 ftp.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/jcsda/CRTM

This code is effectively versions of GPROF2017 and CSU 1DVAR packaged together along with
 the NASA Team 2 (NT2) sea ice algorithm. The GPROF and NT2 calls are commented out
 but can be run and an 'integrated' .nc output file created at the code's conclusion. Note
 that the ancillary data needed to run GPROF is not included but is available elsewhere.
 Absolutely no guarantees are given regarding how up to date or accurate the versions of 
 GPROF or NT2 are here. 

The retrieval code is run in two steps. First, the preprocessor reads the L1 Tb data from
 GMI L1CR and attaches ancillary data to each pixel from the global analysis data of 
 choice, in this case GEOS5 FP-IT (gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/products). The preprocessor dumps
 out a .pp binary file which is then the input to the retrieval. The retrieval code
 (executable 'goe') is then run and outputs files in .nc format. To change which pixels or
 regions are run by the retrieval, modify define_intam2.f.

Provided as well are the L2 file corresponding to Fig. 7 in the below paper and a year of
 gridded retrievals used to create Fig. 12 in the paper, both in .nc format. 

See Duncan et al. (in review) JGRA, for algorithm description and analysis, or email
